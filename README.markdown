#Deterministic C Library for Linux

 * Deterministic syscall interface
 * Emulate Linux C standard library functions (eg. mmap, fork)
 * Example programs

##Acknowledgements

Some of the code in `inc/` and `lib` is derived from MIT's JOS operating system.
I will do my best to document which files came from JOS.
